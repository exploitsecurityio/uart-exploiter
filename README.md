# Description

The UART-Exploiter module, developed in python, is designed to be used by Security Researchers who require quick access to a UART interface using an physical FTDI cable.  Originally developed as a standlone module standalone, however it will become apart of a much larger Exploiter Toolkit in the near future. The module allows for UART passthrough and baud rate scanning.

# Pre-requisites:

- [PyFtdi Library](https://eblot.github.io/pyftdi/)
