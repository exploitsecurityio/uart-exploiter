# Description

The UART-Exploiter module, developed in python, is designed to be used by Security Researchers who require quick access to a UART interface using an physical FTDI cable. 

Originally developed as a standlone module, however further development is underway to incorporate this into a much larger Exploit Security Toolkit in the future. 

The module allows for UART passthrough mode and a rudimentary UART baud scan, when used alonside a physical FTDI cable.
